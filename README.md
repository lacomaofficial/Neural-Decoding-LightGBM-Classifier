# Neuroimaging Decoding with LightGBM
In this project, we'll train a light gradient-boosting machine classifier to decode brain signals using the Haxby dataset.


Here's a quick overview:

1. **Data Preparation**: We fetch the Haxby dataset, set up paths, load functional MRI data, and mask and preprocess it for analysis.

2. **LightGBM Modeling**: We train and fine-tune a LightGBM classifier to predict cognitive categories. Our model excels in identifying faces and rest states.

3. **Performance Assessment**: Through classification reports, we assess prediction precision for various cognitive categories.

4. **Feature Importance Visualization**: Visualizing feature importances, we unveil key brain regions driving our model's predictions.

5. **Project Conclusion**: We summarize our journey, highlighting our successes in predicting cognitive categories and offering insights into cognitive attributes.
